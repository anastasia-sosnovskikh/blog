As some might know, I lived in Australia for a bit, and I am fascinated by that place. Hence, many of my wonderings are related to the world down under.  

Let's get the definitions straight: 

* poisonous is something that is harmful when ingested 
* venomous is something that may go after you to harm you (:

So, I was wondering why the most deadliest spiders and snakes are in Australia? Does it have something to do with the climate there?  
Is it even true that the most venomous animals live in hot places?

Let's get some data here.. to be continued on [my github page](https://github.com/anastasia-sosnovskikh).
