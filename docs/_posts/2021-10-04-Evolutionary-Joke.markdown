Yet another post related to Australia.

The most deadliest spider on earth, Sydney Funnel Web (by the way, I love it, it's so fascinating! I might want to write abother post just about this spider. In the meantime, check out [this](https://inchem.org/documents/pims/animal/atrax.htm) link! No pictures, I promise...)

Anyway, the most deadliest spider on earth (deadliest to humans) is evolved when there were no humans or primates around.
Because there are no primates in Australia... duh. Ironically, its venom is the most potent for guess who? Right, for exactly this group - primates! These are the species that have the most severe allergic reaction to the venom if you will. To keep it short, most species deliver different protein molecules some of which can be hemotoxins or neurotoxins. The `-toxins` part hints on it being dangerous. Basically, you die of suffocation because you can't breathe. For someone who is a neuro nerd as I am: the reason is that the venom has `delta-hexatoxin` (`Delta-hexatoxin-Ar1a` to be specific, and check [this](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01478) out as well) which inhibits the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This makes the cells to be in the excited state for longer causing respiratory depression and circulatory failure resulting in death. You can read more about the mechanisms in [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/40/24920) research paper.

The venom has to get into your bloodstream to have an effect though. Thus, for example, drinking the venom would be safe! Let me end this post on this positive note.. :)
