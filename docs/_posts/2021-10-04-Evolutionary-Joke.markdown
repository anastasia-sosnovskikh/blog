Yet another post related to Australia.

The most deadliest spider on earth, Sydney Funnel Web (by the way, I love it, it's so fascinating! I might want to write abother post just about this spider...)  

Anyway, the most deadliest spider on earth (deadliest to humans) is evolved when there were no humans or primates around.
There are no primates in Australia... duh. Ironically, its venom is the most potent for guess who? Right, for exactly this group - primates! These are the species that have the most severe allergic reaction to the venom if you will.  

TO keep it short, most species deliver different protein molecules some of which can be hemotoxins or neurotoxins.  

The venom has to get into your bloodstream to have an effect though. Thus, drinking the venom would be safe! Let me end this post on this positive note.. :)
