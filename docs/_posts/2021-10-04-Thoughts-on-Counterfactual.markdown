The consequences of an action should be evaluated relative to what would have happened if the action were not taken — the counterfactual.  


For instance, if you rush to give first aid to someone injured on the street, then your ‘tangible’ impact is whatever help you deliver to the injured person.
However, your counterfactual impact depends on what would have happened if you hadn’t acted. For example, if there was someone else in the crowd better qualified to give first aid, then by stepping in, you might have made the situation worse rather than better. 
Thus, it’s possible to have a negative counterfactual impact while having a positive tangible impact.   
So, what's better?
